This program is designed to help the user organise their Spotify playlists.
It does this mainly by:
 - letting the user select a playlist start time, and crossfade length
 - showing the user the start and end times of every song, if played in order,
   and taking into account crossfade length
Future versions should include:
 - the ability to stage changes to playlists within the program, before pushing
   the changes to Spotify's servers
