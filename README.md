This program is designed to help the user organise their Spotify playlists.
It does this mainly by:
 - letting the user select a playlist start time, and crossfade length
 - showing the user the start and end times of every song, if played in order,
   and taking into account crossfade length
Future versions should include:
 - the ability to stage changes to playlists within the program, before pushing
   the changes to Spotify's servers, to reduce network use.
 - a drag-and-drop gui
 - the ability to set clusters of songs to be grouped, then leaving the rest
   up to the program to do
 - setting certain start times for specific songs, and letting the program work
   around that
 - in distant, distant versions, would potentially like the program to become
   a fully-featured spotify app that can play music, and can take requests via
   a phone app. But let's stick to the basics first.
